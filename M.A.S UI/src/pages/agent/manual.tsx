              The Campaign Pipeline is the full end-to-end process for producing a marketing campaign.

            <Section title="Step by step">
              <Step n={1}><strong>Start it:</strong> type <Cmd>run the campaign pipeline</Cmd> in samm chat, or combine it with a calendar event. samm targets the next event on your calendar.</Step>
              <Step n={2}><strong>Planning:</strong> samm researches similar campaigns and plans your post schedule. The campaign runs for up to 14 days before the event — never longer than the lead time available.</Step>
              <Step n={3}><strong>Campaign plan arrives in Inbox:</strong> samm sends you a structured plan — event, key message, call to action, post schedule, and hashtags — and waits for you to review it.</Step>
              <Step n={4}><strong>You approve or reject:</strong> click Approve on the Inbox card to continue, or Reject to cancel the whole campaign.</Step>
              <Step n={5}><strong>Writing:</strong> samm agrees on the core message first — a headline, call to action, and key fact that stays the same across every platform. Then it writes all the posts at the same time, adapting only the length and format per platform.</Step>
              <Step n={6}><strong>Design brief arrives in Content:</strong> alongside the copy drafts, samm creates a Canva-ready design brief — brand colors, fonts, platform dimensions, and your social handles — so your designer has everything they need.</Step>
              <Step n={7}><strong>You review the posts:</strong> go to Content → Drafts to review. Approve posts one by one or tap "Approve all" for the whole campaign. Rejecting a post sends a revision request to your Inbox.</Step>
              <Step n={8}><strong>Readiness check + report:</strong> once all posts are approved, samm runs a quick check and drops a campaign summary in your Inbox.</Step>
              <Step n={9}><strong>Scheduling:</strong> approved posts are queued on each platform's best posting days. All platforms go out together on the first day, then follow their own schedule after that.</Step>
